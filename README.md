## ‚ùá Introduction
Takere for healthcare professionals (HCP) is a system that allows the definition of a care plan along with monitoring patients‚Äô progress. It is developed using [React](https://reactjs.org), which is a framework for creating websites using component-oriented programming.

### Care plan flow
We use drag-and-drop concept for building a care plan flow. The system shows care plan elements available for use in the flow. To include an element in the flow, the user needs to drag it and drop it in the flow (Figure 1). After that, it is necessary to connect these elements. Each connection is an arrow, indicating a dependency relation. For example, if an element Y should be generated only after an element X was completed, then the user must connect X with Y (in this order), resulting in the Figure 2.
Each flow must begin with the ‚ÄôBegin‚Äô element, which indicates when the care plan begins and when it ends (Figure 3). If the end date is unknown, it can be marked as ‚Äôundefined end‚Äô, indicating the flow should stay active without a time to become disabled. Finally, each flow has a name, a description, and the email of the target patient.

### Monitoring patients
After a care plan flow is created, the target patient of the flow can start his/her treatment. When care plan elements are completed by him/her, results about this patient become available. This information can be monitored by HCP, seeing which elements have been completed, which are ongoing and those that are late (Figure 4). It is also possible to see patient input, if the element has inputs (Figure 5).

## üó∫ Project structure
![architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/takere/takere-hcp/master/docs/images/design/architecture.png)

This front-end system has no information about the semantics of a care plan element and knows only its structure. The business logic is in [Takere - API](https://github.com/takere/takere-api).
